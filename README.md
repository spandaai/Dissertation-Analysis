## Dissertation Analysis Application Setup Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### 2. Navigate to the Repository
```bash
cd dissertation-analysis
```

### 3. Run Quickstart Script

#### For Linux to build the docker image from source files
```bash
cd Docker-build
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```
#### For Linux to use latest existing image of application
```bash
cd Docker
docker network create app_network
docker compose up
```

#### For Windows to build the docker image from source files
```cmd
./quickstart.bat
```
#### For Windows to use latest existing image of application
```cmd

```

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure Docker is installed and running
- Check that you have the required permissions
- Verify your Hugging Face token is valid
- Confirm all environment variables are correctly set

## Notes
- Make sure to keep your `.env` file secure and do not commit it to version control
- If you encounter any issues, check the Docker logs for detailed error messages

## Steps to build the backend of the Application

### Build from Source

1. **Clone the Dissertation-Analysis Repository**

2. **Create and Initialize a Python Environment**

For Linux/macOS:
```bash
python3 -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows:
```bash
python -m virtualenv venv
venv/scripts/activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

4. **Launch Dissertation Analysis**

```bash
da-start
```

> You can specify the --port and --host via flags
